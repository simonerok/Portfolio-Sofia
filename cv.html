<h3>Web animations</h3>
<p>I have used an animation that fades in the website using opacity that goes from 0 % to 100% which creates this "blink" effect. The animation is made with JavaScript by importing the animation and then use it and in CSS by using keyframes. </p>

<h3>Dark mode</h3>
<p> I have created a button that can switch between the dark mode and light mode. One important thing I have learned while creating the dark mode is that it doesn't necessarily have to be a transition from dark to light or from black to white. </p>
